# Mathematical-modeling-of-Hematopoietic-stem-cells-
This repository intends to show my work performed for my Master's thesis where I developed a stochastic model of hematopoietic stem cell dynamics in MATLAB 

# Objective 
I aimed to develop a user-friendly computational platform based on single-cell stochastic model. This platform serve to investigate the dynamics of hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs and ST-HSCs) from a discrete and stochastic perspective, enabling the simulation of these populations’ growth over time.
