function [x,y] = diff2dEV_cells(x,y,Nt,dtBrow,EV,Dfin,Lx,Ly)


% Parameters
  dt = dtBrow;  % Time step (supposedly time is in the same units as the cell model)
  Df = Dfin;    % The units are L^2/t, the time is given by the cell model. 
                % Length is the same as Lx and Ly. Df is going to be a
                % small value. 
                % in general dtBrown < Df/2 for stability of the Euler-Maruyama method 

                % a ball park estimate of diffusion coefficient for cells is 600 Âµm^2/min
                % for 1440 minutes in a day, if the cell model has time
                % step of 1 day, this code should run for 1440 dtBrown for
                % each of those steps. (Df = 600, dtBrown = 1 min
